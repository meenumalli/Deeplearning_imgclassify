# Deeplearning_imgclassify
Image classification (cat or dog)
Personal Project: Implementing Deep Neural Networks with Keras for Image Classification and Recognition

Objective: To develop a deep learning model using Keras to accurately classify and recognize images.

Data Source: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and consisted of cat or Dog images for classification.

Approach: The project involved loading the data and constructing a deep neural network using Keras. Used techniques such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers to construct the model. They  evaluated the model to ensure that it is performing well in accurately classifying and recognizing images.

Results: The final model achieved an accuracy of 90%, indicating that it is performing well in accurately classifying and recognizing images.
